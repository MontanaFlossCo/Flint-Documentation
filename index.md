title: Flint Documentation
---

This is the latest documentation for the Flint framework for Apple platforms.

## Example projects

You can find a sample application built with Flint in the [FlintDemo-iOS repository](https://github.com/MontanaFlossCo/FlintDemo-iOS). This project is a simple note-taking app with support for photo attachments, showing some patterns for using Flint in apps that use storyboards and some service components such as a data store. It includes a "Debug" button that will show you the various FlintUI debug tools.
