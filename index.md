## Philosophy

We are all-in on Swift but we don’t want to be smartypants who can’t read our own code weeks later. We take a few advanced Swift features that make great things possible: Protocol Oriented Programming, some generics and a very small amount of associated types.

We deliberately avoid the more oblique patterns because we want this framework to be very accessible and easy for everybody to reason about, irrespective of the paradigm they have chosen for their codebase.
