This is the latest documentation for the Flint framework for Apple platforms.

Try the [Getting Started](guides/getting_started.md) guide to add Flint to your project or see [Features and Actions](guides/features_and_actions.md) if you want to see what all the fuss is about before trying it out.

You can find a sample application built with Flint in the [FlintDemo-iOS repository](https://github.com/MontanaFlossCo/FlintDemo-iOS).

View the [community](guides/community.md) page for details of how to find help from humans, and how to contribute!
