## Overview

The Timeline feature of Flint is a rolling limited-length history of all actions performed in the app across all sessions and features. This is a sequential way to see exactly what has happened in the app at a high level.

It is incredibly valuable if captured and included in logs or support requests.

## Using the Timeline Browser from FlintUI on iOS

```swift
import UIKit
import FlintUI

... in some action or gesture handler of a UIViewController ...

guard let request = TimelineBrowserFeature.request(TimelineBrowserFeature.show) else {
    preconditionFailure("Timeline is not enabled")
}
request.perform(using: self)
```

This will show the modal UI listing a live-updating timeline of actions performed. You can tap items to get more details.

## Disabling Timeline

The Timeline feature is enabled by default. If you do not use it or would rather not have the overhead in certain builds, you can easily disable it:

```swift
TimelineFeature.isEnabled = false
```
