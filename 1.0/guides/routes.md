# Routes

Most apps need to handle some URLs, whether for e-mail sign-in confirmations, deep linking or custom workflow URL schemes.

Flint’s Routes feature makes it easy to implement these. You have only two steps to carry out in code.

Routes can work automatically behind the scenes with the [Activities](activities.md) feature.
